## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the style from recipes using ingredients. To use and train models in this project, the dataset has to be placed under `/data/01_raw`. The `main.py` file can be used to train models, whereas the `analysis_clean.py` file is used to clean and show stats for the dataset. Some lines have to be commented in depending on what should be used.  

The Python version used is 3.7 since some require packages do not work with newer versions yet.

## Dataset

As the datasets can be quite big, not all are included in the repository. They can be downloaded from here:
